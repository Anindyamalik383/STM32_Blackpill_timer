Since the STM32 CUBE IDE produces a lot of files, I uploaded the main files here that are needed. Additionally, the main.c file is the one where all of the main code is, including timer setup and all.
Pin definition includes RX ---> PA9
                       TX ---> PA10
                       LED ---> PC13
For serial communication, the STM is set to a baud rate of 115200 
I was unable to find any libraries for STM32F411CEU6 for Proteus that are simulation compatible. 

I will also add a total folder where all of the files will be included together, Folder name --Complete Project.
